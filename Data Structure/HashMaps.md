## Overview

Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

Unless specifically asked to implement a hash table yourself, use the python `dict`

See [[Python Nuances#Hash Maps|Python Dict]] for more details
